            </span>Dynamic symmetry is a novel concept in the design and
 fabrication of gas turbines, breaking away from today’s paradigm in the
 engineering of this kind of engines. Since the compressor and hot gas 
turbine are both turbo-machines sharing many features and working under 
the same physical phenomena, the dynamic symmetry concept seeks to 
combine the expansion and compression functions in a unique rotor 
element, therefore reducing its structural requirements to the bare 
minimum whilst achieving an excellent cooling scheme.<br>

Albeit the rule defining this criterion remains relatively simple, the 
reality is that the general concept remains unintuitive and results 
difficult to completely understand without the help of drawings because 
its application generates three-dimensional unconventional geometries. 
Despite this, once understood, this new technique translates into the 
design of simple architectures which have resulted being naturally 
functional and versatile. A detailed description of this technology is 
hereafter proposed.<br>

The dynamic symmetry strategy is specifically used in the design of the 
turbine rotors, be it for axial, radial or mixed flow. When constructed,
 the particularities of these rotors have a significant impact on the 
overall conception of turbo-machines into which they are integrated, 
leading to their structures also being unconventional. Dynamic symmetry 
foils rotor are simply made by joining two types of foils, one being a 
pressure foil (active surface) and the other being a suction foil 
(passive surface), whose unconventional shapes are derived from the 
dynamic symmetry criterion. Due to this technique, the rotor works 
simultaneously as a pump and motor, substantially reducing the need for 
structural materials in its fabrication. Any surface of the rotor is in 
contact with the expanding fluid on one of its sides whilst also being 
in contact with the compressing fluid on the other.<br>

One of the foil types performs the function of active surface for the 
compression on one of its sides and expansion on the other. Similarly, 
the other type of foil performs the function of a passive surface for 
compression on one of its sides and expansion on the other one.<br>
            <br>
Figure 1 shows a dynamic symmetry active surface 1 in which the paths of
 the expanding flow 2 and the compressing flow 3, represented by arrow 
tiers, can also be seen. Notice how said curved paths induce the 
creation of a pressure differential between the surface and the fluid. 
It can be observed in this theoretical example how the geometry and the 
paths exhibit symmetry with respect to an imaginary straight line 
passing through the two opposed vertex of the surface.<br>
<br>
Figure 2 shows a dynamic symmetry passive surface 4 in which the paths 
of the expanding flow 2 and the compressing flow 3, represented by arrow
 tiers, can also be seen. Notice how said curved paths induce the 
apparition of a suction force between the surface and the fluid. As what
 happens with classical axial flow blades, the dynamic symmetry passive 
surface has a more pronounced curvature than that of the active surface.<br>
<br>
Due to the special geometrical characteristics in a dynamic symmetry 
foils rotor, it is not possible to consider the classic concept of blade
 as a constructive element. The rotor is built by adequately joining a 
series of foils where the active with the passive ones alternate in such
 a way that two types of equally alternative channels are formed, one 
assigned to conducting the compressing fluid whilst the other, adjacent 
to the first, assigned to conducting the expanding fluid.<br>

Figure 3 shows the joining of a dynamic symmetry passive surface 4 and 
two dynamic symmetry active surfaces 1. This view demonstrates how the 
passages are formed through which both the expanding flow 2 and the 
compressing flow 3 must circulate.<br>
<br>
Notice how the passive surface 4 is joined by two boundaries with one of
 its adjacent active surface 1, while the other two join the other 
active surface 1. The same happens in a reciprocal way for the active 
surfaces with respect to the passive ones. As can be seen in this 
example, the dynamic symmetry active surface will have all of its 
boundaries joined to a passive surface; however, the same does not hold 
for the dynamic symmetry passive surface which will have some 
unconnected edges. Although it is perfectly reasonable to conceive both 
or only the active surface with the previously described free edges, the
 main reason for this setup is merely a geometric convenience. 
Nonetheless, such a design would generate strained geometries.<br>
<br>
The fact that a passage ends up being one of compression or expansion 
does not depend on the surface geometry but rather on how the whole 
machine is configured and the rotor’s direction of rotation.<br>
<br>
Both types of foils are very similar in their shape and can therefore be
 obtained with analogous manufacturing processes. The foils have to be 
joined together by their edges through a welding process, adhesive 
application, slot fittings in rotors that can be dismantled or any other
 convenient method. The possibility of using a fabrication process 
allowing for the building of the rotor in a single element without the 
need of manufacturing separate foils and their posterior joining, is not
 discarded.<br>

With the goal of demonstrating the arrangement of the dynamic symmetry 
foils rotor intended for an axial flow, Figure 6 shows a perspective of 
an axially cut basic gas turbine engine where arrows indicate its 
rotation direction and the paths of its internal gasses.<br>
Figure 7 shows a schematic section of the same engine. A clean air flow 
14 enters the engine and reaches the rotor 15 passing through its 
compression passages. The partially compressed air then exits the rotor 
with great kinetic energy at 16.&nbsp; The air is then conducted through
 a spiral volute to the combustor intake 17, where it is fully 
compressed and loses most of its kinetic energy. It exits the combustor 
18 after having thermal energy added to it and is conducted up to 19 
through another spiral volute where part of its pressure has been lost 
and great kinetic energy has been gained. It then enters the expansion 
passages of the rotor 15 where it yields part of its energy to the rotor
 and finally leaves the engine at 20.<br>
<br>
Notice the rotor has been qualified as one of axial flow since this 
configuration does not take advantage in any way of the radial component
 of the flow, that is, the compressing flow circulates towards the 
rotation axis and the expanding flow moves away from it.<br>
<br>
In real applications these dynamic symmetry surfaces will unlikely 
present any geometric symmetry due to the disparity in thermodynamic 
conditions among the expanding and compressing flows. The real foil 
surfaces with which the rotors will finally be built will be derived 
from the theoretical criterion of dynamic symmetry whilst attending to 
resistance requirements, mechanical fluids optimization, heat transfer 
considerations and suitability of the specific application for which it 
is being designed. It is not assumed that foils feature a uniform 
thickness, which will depend on the design needs of each case.<br>

The drawings and simplified schematics presented in this document are 
offered as examples and do not correspond to actual designs. Since they 
are highly didactic, the previously shown figures represent surfaces 
designed for axial flows. The fact that the flow type be predominantly 
radial or axial is something merely circumstantial and does not alter 
the application of the dynamic symmetry criterion.<br>
In order for an energy transfer between the rotor and the fluid to 
exist, motion (rotation) and force (pressure) are needed. The pressure 
differential existing between the surface and the fluid is caused by the
 accelerations of the latter, that is, speed changes in the fluid both 
in modulus and direction. The speed change in the fluid may be due to 
the surface curvature, as in the axial flow, or to the speed change of 
that very surface at different distances from the rotation axis, as in 
the radial flow, or may be due to a mixture of both reasons. When 
intended for axial flows, the dynamic symmetry surface has a double 
curvature and its shape resembles a horse saddle. When intended for 
radial flows, the dynamic symmetry surface could be flat since the speed
 changes don’t depend on the existence of a curvature but on the greater
 or lesser proximity to the rotation axis. From a geometrical point of 
view, the dynamic symmetry surface intended for radial flows may be 
considered as a limit to that of axial flows in which the 
curvature is null.<br>
Independently from the rotor configuration, flows in which the surface 
curvature is responsible for the fluid accelerations that further 
contribute to the energy transfer between the rotor and the fluid, are 
known as axial; flows in which the variation of distance from the 
rotation axis is the main cause for the fluid accelerations that further
 contribute to the energy transfer between the rotor and the fluid, are 
known as radial; flows in which both the surface curvature and the 
variation of distance from the rotation axis are responsible for the 
accelerations that further contribute to the energy transfer between the
 rotor and the fluid, are known as mixed.<br>

A schematic axial section of a turbo-prop engine with dynamic symmetry 
foils rotor 15 intended for axial flows, whose combustion chamber 31 is 
centred, is shown in Figure 8. <br>
The rotor is akin to the one shown in figure 5.<br>
The engine body is composed of an exterior casing 38 and a central body 
40 connected by a stator 39. The propeller blades are part of an 
external rotor 37 that has an internal stage of conventional blades 35 
to assist the compression and another stage of conventional turbine 
blades 36 which drive the whole external rotor with the exhaust gasses. 
In this case, the rotor built with dynamic symmetry foils 15 is only 
used for compression while the output power is obtained with the blades 
36 of the exterior rotor 37. The exterior rotor 37 and the dynamic 
symmetry foils rotor 15 are counter rotating.<br>
<br>
Fuel and electrical ignition are supplied to the combustion chamber 31 
through the conduct 33. The engine can be started with the injection of 
compressed air from a bottle into the combustion chamber through conduct
 33 and, once started, the same conduct 33 can be used to refill the 
same bottle with compressed air taken from the combustion chamber inlet.
 The flow of clean air 14 is partially accelerated and compressed by the
 blades 35 of the exterior rotor 37 and reaches the rotor 15 passing 
through its compression passages. It then exits the rotor 15 and enters 
the compression spiral volute 30 which leads it to the combustion 
chamber 31. After having thermal energy added to it, the flow exits the 
combustion chamber and enters the expansion spiral volute 32 which 
brings it up to the rotor 15. The gas passes through the expansion 
passages of the rotor 15 where it yields part of its energy. After 
leaving the rotor 15 it acts on the turbine blades 36 delivering its 
power to the exterior rotor 37 before finally exiting the engine at 20. </td>

Figures 9 and 10 show two axially cut views of a turbo-fan engine driven
 by a dynamic symmetry foils rotor intended for mixed flows, in which 
the rotor’s sense of rotation is indicated.<br>
<br>
Figure 11 shows the schematic of the previously described turbo-fan 
engine’s axial section. The engine can be started injecting compressed 
air from a bottle into the combustion chamber, which is external.<br>
The fresh air entering 14, passes through the compression passages of 
the rotor 15. The majority of the air is expelled at 48, obtaining 
thrust, whilst the rest of the pumped air is directed to the compression
 volute 30, and from there, up to the combustion chamber. After having 
thermal energy added to it, the air exits the combustion chamber and 
enters the expansion volute 32 which then conducts it up to the rotor 
15. The gas passes through the expansion passages of the rotor 15 where 
it yields its energy and is finally exhausted to the exterior at 20. The
 air used for thrust 48, is forced to pass through a stator 49 before 
escaping the engine.<br>
<br>
Notice how the rotor has been described as a mixed flow one since this 
configuration does take advantage of the radial component of the 
compressing flow; that is, it moves away from the rotation axis 
while the expanding one circulates towards it.<br>
The next figures clearly show this rotor’s foil geometry which is 
designed to pump a great volume of air through its central zone while 
not giving it too much speed.<br>
<br>
Figure 12 shows perspectives of the joint between one dynamic symmetry 
passive surface and two dynamic symmetry active surfaces of the rotor 15
 of figure 11. Notice the wideness of the compression passage with 
respect to the expansion one. The left view gives a better appreciation 
of the inlet zones from both the compression and expansion passages, 
while the right view gives a better appreciation of the outlet 
zones.<br>

The radial flow can be considered a limit case of a mixed flow in which 
the net curvature of the flow is null and, thus, a radial rotor designed
 with the same techniques as a mixed one would be perfectly feasible. 
However, the design flexibility provided by the dynamic symmetry 
criterion allows for more advantageous radial flow solutions. As will be
 demonstrated in the following figures, it is possible to manufacture a 
dynamic symmetry foils rotor in which the compressing flow does not need
 to forcibly overcross the expanding flow, and in which it is 
unnecessary that the passages be completely shaped by the active and 
passive surfaces.<br>

Figure 13 shows a schematic diagram for the axial section of a 
turbo-machine that uses a radial flow dynamic symmetry foils rotor 15 in
 order to exchange energy between two fluid currents. The figure also 
shows a perspective of a dynamic symmetry active surface 1 of that 
rotor. The paths of the expanding flow 2 and compressing flow 3 can be 
seen represented through of arrow strips.<br>
<br>
Notice that in the central area, both the expanding flow 2 and the 
compressing flow 3 circulate almost parallel without their paths ever 
crossing.<br>
<br>
The fluid being compressed enters the turbo-machine at 14, near the axis
 of rotation, continuing to the compression passages of the rotor 15 
where it receives energy by radially circulating up to the volute 56 on 
the periphery. The expanding fluid arrives through volute 57, on the 
periphery, passes to the expansion passages of the rotor 15 where it 
yields its energy by radially circulating towards the rotation axis and 
finally leaves the turbo-machine at 20.<br>
<br>
Figure 14 shows perspectives of the rotor 15 from figure 13. One of the 
most differentiating characteristic of this radial flow dynamic symmetry
 foils rotor with respect to those intended for axial or mixed flows is 
that the compression and expansion passages are not sealed between the 
active and passive surfaces but rather one part of them must be sealed 
by the turbine housing, as can be seen at point 55 of figure 13. This is
 also a common characteristic in conventional radial turbo-machines. 
This area of the passages sealed by the housing coincides with the area 
in which the expanding flow 2 and the compressing flow 3 circulate in an
 almost parallel direction.<br>

In this example the geometry of the surfaces is very simple: a flat 
active surface and a passive surface close to a ruled surface. With this
 design being perfectly feasible, it can still be optimized giving the 
adequate warp to the surfaces in order to better fit the axial type flow
 predominant in the areas close to the rotation axis such as is shown in
 the following figure.<br>

This same optimization to an axial type flow predominant in the areas 
close to the rotation axis can also be achieved using fins, obtaining a 
similar effect with less forced geometries, as shown on the rotor of the
 following figure. These fins, as opposed to dynamic symmetry surfaces, 
are bathed by the same fluid on both sides, that is, they are merely a 
prolongation since once isolated and contrary to the rest of the 
surface, they fail to comply with the dynamic symmetry criterion. They 
could also easily be used in dynamic symmetry foils rotors intended for 
axial or mixed flow, although they are especially convenient for radial 
ones since a markedly axial flow area usually exists.<br>

Since rotors not only interact with the fluid but are also integrated in
 a machine, it will usually be necessary for them to be adapted so as to
 perform other functions. Thus, the foils can optionally present 
appendixes on specific parts of their edges in an assembly wing fashion 
which can serve as a bearing, airtight seal, balancer, foil assembly 
point in demountable rotors or to house other accessories.<br>
<br>
Figure 18 shows a perspective of a dynamic symmetry passive surface on 
which some appendages named assembly wings have been added to the free 
edges. These assembly wings are simply extensions of the surface 
structure that can be used in several ways according to the convenience 
of the application. They are present on the passive surface due to its 
free edges, but they could just as well be on the active one. They 
usually serve as bearings in order to transmit efforts to the 
turbo-machine structure into which the rotor is integrated, also as a 
surface on which to effect an airtight sealing, as a support for rotor 
driven accessories, or as assembly point for other elements. When 
integrating several rotors in the turbo-machine, it is probable that 
both the sealing and effort transmission takes place between these very 
rotors in addition to taking place between the rotor and the 
turbo-machine. Furthermore, the assembly wings will host the 
counterweights derived from the balancing operation of the rotor.<br>
<br>
The following figure shows a perspective of a sectioned electric 
generator, useful in illustrating various aspects. The dynamic symmetry 
foils rotor intended for axial flows is equipped with assembly wings 22 
which act as a bearing and airtight seal along with a support for an 
outer 23 and inner 21 ring.<br>
Whilst, from an operative point of view, these rings are not essential, 
they become convenient due to the fact they are elements with a 
continuous structure and can therefore conform to more detailed designs 
requiring a single milling process. These rings could obviously be 
joined to the foils without requiring assembly wings. These rings can be
 used to perform the same functions as the assembly wings and, in 
particular, act as a chassis for the tuning of dynamic symmetry surfaces
 in demountable rotors. A reasonable technique in the building of 
demountable rotors intended for axial or mixed flows would be to use the
 set resulting from welding an active surface, with no assembly wings, 
and a passive surface, which does have assembly wings on its free edges,
 as a constructive element.<br>
Additionally, the outer ring 23 contains the mobile electromagnetic 
elements 9 as accessories which interact with the fixed elements 10, 
embedded into the machine structure.<br>

It is to be expected that these kind of designs present several 
advantages such as eliminating the need of a shaft to transmit the power
 from turbine to compressor, diminishing the length and weight of the 
engine, rotors materials are better refrigerated allowing for greater 
operational temperatures and a lower diluted air ratio, the 
refrigeration process itself involves a heat recovery effect improving 
overall thermal efficiency, the foils suffer less mechanical stresses 
thanks to partial compensation of the fluid pressure on both sides of 
its surfaces. The obligation to cross the compressing and expanding 
fluids in the same rotor does not necessarily imply having to provide 
notably larger sections than that of conventional rotors, since what is 
sought and achieved with the dynamic symmetry is to exploit otherwise 
unused spaces of conventional rotor blades, particularly if the use of 
high pressure geometries is intended. It is also significant that the 
lower inertia of the rotors allows for the injection of compressed air 
directly into the combustion chambers as a starting procedure thus 
allowing for the replacement of otherwise heavier and slower 
conventional systems.<br>
When embracing the dynamic symmetry criterion, 2D classic design 
methodology is left aside in favour of more powerful modern engineering 
tools in order to concentrate the technological effort in the 
unconventional 3D geometries design of two warped foils and their later 
manufacture. Although this technology is at a very early development 
phase, it is necessary to mention that, apart from its operative 
advantages, a lot of trust has been put in the building technique of the
 rotors where joining two types of warped foils could constitute an 
important new step in the industrial process of gas turbine 
manufacturing.<br>

Whilst these claimed advantages are desirable in any gas turbine engine 
application, the dynamic symmetry concept may be particularly useful in 
low power turbines and micro-turbines, portable power generation units, 
distributed electrical power generation, auxiliary engines for vertical 
lift on VTOL aircrafts, primary generators in hybrid propulsion, quick 
start turbine engines, turbo-blowers, etc.<br>
One promising application of this technology is found in military 
applications where the automated manufacturing of disposable dynamic 
symmetry foils rotors could lead to a new generation of very economic 
power plants intended for motorizing unmanned combat machines or cruise 
missiles. These kinds of platforms, designed for a single use or a 
limited operative life expectancy where maximum simplicity without 
renouncing to efficiency is pursued, would allow the reduction of costs 
of not only the production but also the preventive maintenance, reducing
 these operations only to the full replacement of rotors.<br>

the prior state of the art<br>
            </h3>
It is well known that one of the most limiting factors in gas turbine 
design is the high combustion temperature needed to achieve good 
efficiency, although this adversely affects the materials resistance. In
 order to solve this problem, apart from improving alloys, several 
techniques whose purpose is to cool the blades from the hot gases have 
been proposed, allowing them to work at higher temperatures. Systems 
based on incorporating the blades with cooling circuits through 
more or less complex channels in which a refrigerant fluid must 
circulate already exist. Another system uses porous materials or 
mechanizes orifices at strategic intervals in order to keep the blade 
surface covered with a thin film of cold gas injected under pressure 
from its core, isolating the blades from the high temperatures of 
exhaust gases. There is yet another system which exploits the idea of 
using the hollow 
blades of a conventional axial turbine as a radial compressor forcing 
the fresh air to circulate through its interior before entering the 
combustor to later redirect the hot gases proceeding from the combustor 
through a loop against the blades of the axial turbine. In this way, it 
is possible to cool the turbine blades which act simultaneously as a 
radial pump and axial motor.<br>
This hollow blade based system, although not exactly considered an 
antecedent, does show an important parallelism with the dynamic symmetry
 criterion due to the fact that the fresh compressed air is also in 
charge of directly refrigerating the rotor surfaces in contact with hot 
gases proceeding from the combustor, having it act as a pump and a motor
 at the same time. Nonetheless, the idea of conceiving a hollow blade as a conduct through 
which the air can circulate radially, although useful and very 
intuitive, imposes certain limitations that can end up being potentially
 inconvenient since it conditions the machine configuration where it 
forces the exit location of the compressed air flow towards the 
periphery of the rotor and, at the same time, the tubular geometry of 
the blades conditions the radial flow transitions to and from the rotor.
 These limitations can be solved thanks to the dynamic symmetry strategy 
which provides smooth inflow and outflow profiles without the need to 
add strange elements intended to eliminate discontinuities in the flow 
and, at the same time, allows for innovative constructive solutions with
 respect to hollow blades avoiding the constraints of radial compression
 and conventional shapes of existing blades.<br>

            </h3>
Fear and scepticism are natural reactions to new ideas or radical 
changes and can result in a misleading perception of a reality that is 
usually much simpler than it first seems. All gas turbine engines have a
 compressor, a hot gases turbine and, if circumstances permit, a cooling
 and a heat recovery system to increase its efficiency. Dynamic symmetry turbines have the exact same elements, but thanks to 
its innovative architecture, all those elements are integrated simply in
 a lightweight and compact rotor. Based on this, dynamic symmetry has 
never been conceived as a hypothetical technology, it is to say, <b>it is not being researched to find out if it can work, but to find out the best way to make it work</b>.
 Nonetheless, during the dissemination phase of this technology, it has 
been established that some people suffer from an immediate and unfounded
 "rejection effect" when seeing the geometry of a dynamic symmetry foils
 rotor for the first time. The operation of the rotors and curvature of 
the surfaces, distant from conventional ones, can sometimes cause first 
impressions to consider it something extraordinarily complex and that it
 would probably present flow quality problems and make it hardly viable.
 It is true that the passages through which the fluid circulates in a 
dynamic symmetry foils rotor are enclosed by surfaces with a striking 
warping that confer to the same capricious shapes.

The rotor depicted in the previous figures, corresponds to an absolutely
 conventional centrifugal compressor, and not a particularly modern one 
either, similar to those used in many small power gas turbines or in 
supercharging systems of explosion engines. Since it is conventional, seeing it does not cause the impression that 
flow quality problems should appear when fluid circulates through its 
passages. Figures 38, 39 and 40 do not correspond to the passage of a 
dynamic symmetry foils rotor but to the conventional centrifugal rotor 
previously shown. Despite the conventionality of its architecture, any 
expert knows that if it is poorly designed or simply operated outside 
its design parameters, it will also perform poorly.<br>

Dynamic symmetry is a very innovative design concept from an 
architectural point of view, but from a fluid dynamics point of view, 
dynamic symmetry turbines are not so different from conventional ones. 
All of them comprise compression and expansion passages delimited by 
streamlined surfaces with the necessary curvatures and orientations to 
perform their respective functions. Passages are simply conduits through which a fluid circulates and these 
can be designed in many different ways. Some of them will apparently 
seem more conventional and other less, but the behaviour of the fluid is
 not conditioned by the mere fact that the geometry appears conventional
 or not. As a result, there is no objective reason to predict problems 
in dynamic symmetry that may not equally occur in any other conventional
 design and that cannot be treated in exactly the same way.<br>
Its physical viability has never been in question, but, as with any 
other novelty, uncertainties exist and a prudent approach requires 
conducting systematic research leading to quantitative results. <br>
Simply put, detailed studies are planned that allow for the discovery of
 the best design practices when implementing the philosophy of dynamic 
symmetry in order to be able to leverage its advantages and come to 
grasp its limitations and peculiarities.<br>
To associate a high degree of innovation with a high probability of 
malfunction without any explanation is, blatantly, an absurd behavioural
 predisposition. In the end, the good or bad functioning of a design 
will depend on the quality of the engineering work that has been 
invested in it, such holds for conventional turbine as well as 
non-conventional ones. For this reason, <b>any expert studying the dynamic symmetry criterion 
for the first time, must be warned from the possibility of suffering 
this relatively common cognitive prejudice</b> that triggers
 spurious conclusions not based on careful scientific analysis but on a 
subjective and hasty first impression of something that breaks out the 
established.<br>
Although the dynamic symmetry criterion is intended to simplify and 
improve the construction of gas turbines, it must be kept in mind that 
the characteristics of dynamic symmetry foils can almost never be 
assimilated to a two-dimensional geometry, thus, its understanding 
requires a sufficiently developed spatial vision and a set of 3D 
engineering tools.<br>

stage as represented in the longitudinal section of Figure 22. A dynamic
 symmetry foils rotor intended for radial flows could also be used 
although it has been estimated that the mixed flow one has the advantage
 of only being in contact with the casing through the assembly wings 
ultimately requiring less precision in its manufacture.<br>
Logically, the accessible part of the shaft resides in the air intake 
area protected from heat and the aggressive elements of exhaust gases. 
In addition, this allows for a better balancing of the rotor geometry 
where the pass-through section required for the intake nozzle, and for 
thermodynamic reasons, is smaller than that of the exhaust.<br>
<br>
It should be remembered that both the pressure and suction surfaces 
simultaneously delimit the expansion and compression passages and, 
therefore, the geometry of any of them affects both types of passages. 
However, it is true that the compression passages are affected mainly by
 the curvature in a particular direction, whilst expansion passages are 
affected mainly by the curvature in the other direction, as shown in 
Figure 23.<br>
The most energetic fluid flow is the one exiting the combustion chamber,
 reason by which the considerations carried out with respect to the main
 curvatures of the expansion passages will condition the rotation speed,
 speed to which the main curvatures of compression passages will 
subsequently have to be adapted.<br>
The amplitude of the inlet section of the expansion passages will grow 
as the component parallel to the axis plane of the absolute velocity 
vector with which the gases leaving the combustor affects the expansion 
passages gets smaller. Although dynamic symmetry allows for a flexible 
design, in order to achieve less forced geometries, especially for the 
suction surface, it becomes convenient to provide a fairly wide entry 
section for the expansion passages. This is accomplished by making the 
angle of incidence of the gases from the combustor tangent enough to the
 turbine. This will also contribute to reduce the aerodynamic axial 
thrust corresponding to the expansion passages.<br>
Once chosen the rotation speed depending on the expansion passages 
needs, the compression passages outlet usually results significantly 
narrow in comparison with the inlet. This is normally not a problem for 
the design since on the other side of that active surface area, the 
expansion passage is very thin and leads a small proportion of the 
expansion flow.<br>
<br>
To achieve a not too high rotation speed in a turbine with a single 
expansion stage, which has to absorb all the power, working with high 
pressure geometries is needed, implying that the pass through area of 
the passages narrows towards its central part with respect to the inlet 
or outlet (fig. 50). This is achieved naturally by employing the dynamic symmetry strategy. 
Nonetheless, the design offers many degrees of freedom and it can be 
resorted to the centre widening technique in order to accommodate better
 the pass through section, as shown in Fig. 48 and 49.<br>

In reality, to obtain a low rotation speed, this is not the only factor 
to consider for the geometry. In a dynamic symmetry turbine, cooling and
 heat recovery should be clearly differentiated. Both objectives are 
achieved through the same physical mechanism, that is, the heat transfer
 between the compression and expansion passages, although they involve 
different conditions. If the only interest is cooling, it would be 
desirable to use some coating material over the surface of the expansion
 passages which, beside from chemical protection, provides thermal 
insulation. In the case of heat recovery the impact of such coating 
would have to be evaluated along with the amount of exchange surface 
related to the number of pairs of rotor foils. In addition, heat recovery is effective when residual heat is recovered,
 i.e., after extraction of the useful power from hot gases, implying 
that these gases circulate in certain conditions finally having a great 
influence on the foils geometry.<br>
The use of high pressure geometries would also involve, in general, the 
use of sharp leading edges. Although it is a decision that depends on 
fluid dynamics criteria, sharp edges can be particularly interesting if 
the expected construction of the rotor is to be carried out by welding 
of the foils.<br>

Unlike conventional designs, here the passage section is not 
approximately trapezoidal but shaped as a sheath tuned at the ends. This
 can affect the fluid speed at the inlet and outlet of the passages 
presenting a distribution where it would be lower near the ends and 
higher at the centre.<br>
To find out up to what extent this phenomenon manifests itself, a simple
 fluid mechanics calculation with the preliminary geometry of the rotor 
can be carried out, obtaining a qualitative understanding of such 
distribution thus enhancing the initial dimension calculations of inlet 
and outlet sections of the rotor passages.<br>
<br>
In addition, useful qualitative knowledge about the most appropriate 
distances between pressure and suction surfaces can also be obtained 
through this calculation in order to avoid flow separation or excessive 
vorticity.<br>

The area joining the foils to the shaft must be capable of transmitting the aerodynamic torque to the latter. <br>
<br>
A pressure surface is joined to the next suction surface by the blue 
stripped edges, shown in Figure 52, to form the compression passage. In 
turn, this suction surface is joined to the following pressure surface 
by red stripped edges to form the expansion passage, and so on.<br>
In the area uniting them to the shaft (fig. 53), the interference 
between foils creates a bulk of material used for the union. Although 
the geometry of the joining region can easily be modelled in a 
streamlined way, this zone is not particularly important from a fluid 
dynamics point of view, and then it can easily be adapted to fulfil its 
role. Sizing the shaft is simple and the rule that the area of the 
cylindrical surface in which foils join the shaft must be equal to or 
greater than the area of the section of the same shaft can be set as a 
preliminary design standard.<br>

micro-turbine: rotor geometry<br>
            </h4>
As a first application exercise of the dynamic symmetry strategy, a 100 
kW shaft output power micro gas turbine configured with a single mixed 
flow rotor is projected. This study will allow for an insight into more 
realistic geometries and for a comparison of the obtained results with 
other conventional micro turbines. The following conditions will be 
considered in the design:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>The shaft output power will be 100 kW ± 5 kW.</li>
              <li>The rotor will be made of INCONEL 738 or a similar material intended for turbines.</li>
              <li>The fuel will be gasoline or a similar liquid fuel.</li>
              <li>Standard Air: 15 °C, 760 mm Hg.</li>
              <li>The usual industry safety margins will be used.</li>
            </ul>
The design optimization process will seek for maximum efficiency and 
minimum rotor weight that allows for the previously mentioned 
requirements. Hereafter, the steps leading to the preliminary model 
later evaluated and optimized through numerical calculation software, 
are described.<br>
<br>
The first step in order to work with the dynamic symmetry philosophy is 
to free oneself from prejudices and constrains blocking originality and 
to clarify some concepts that are important to keep in mind throughout 
the process:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>To innovate is essentially to step out of line, but if
 something is unconventional, it does not necessarily mean it is absurd 
or very complex.</li>
              <li>Flow paths don’t need to be two-dimensional or near 
two-dimensional. A fluid can have a three-dimensional path since what is
 really important are the thermodynamic conditions at the beginning and 
end of these paths.</li>
              <li>Surfaces on which the flow passes need not to be 
approximately developable nor do they need to correspond to extruded 
two-dimensional profiles. A three-dimensional geometry with irregular 
warping can also correctly conduct the fluid if properly designed.</li>
              <li>Often, a characteristic that produces negative effects
 simultaneously provokes positive ones which must be weighed before 
discarding it.</li>
              <li>A dynamic symmetry foils rotor is simultaneously a 
compressor, turbine and heat recovery. This interaction causes its 
design to have more degrees of freedom than that existing in each 
element separately, but only one element is designed, not three.</li>
            </ul>
Taking into account the previous constraints, assuming tentative values 
for certain parameters and using the elemental thermodynamic formulae of
 the Brayton cycle, it is possible to estimate the operating variables 
of the turbo-machine and inlets and outlets areas of the compression and
 expansion rotor passages. With those data an axial cutaway of the 
micro-turbine can be sketched. Using velocity triangles the main fluid 
orientations at the inlets and outlets of the passages are calculated 
which, in turn, allows for the drawing of the basic three-dimensional 
curves which will define the rotor foils geometry.<br>

As was foreseeable, the very different thermodynamic properties of the 
compressing and expanding flows cause the actual geometry to be quite 
different from the theoretical symmetry. Note how the compression 
passages have their outlets oriented perpendicular to the rotation axis 
in order to avoid the axial component of the thrust generated by the 
compressed air flow whilst the same thrust counteracts the centrifugal 
force on the foils. Reducing the pressure at the outlet of the 
compression passages forces the flow speed to increase. This may not 
make much sense in a conventional design, but in a dynamic symmetry 
foils rotor, the resulting temperature reduction could improve 
refrigeration, converting it into a factor to consider. After 
tentatively choosing the number of pressure surfaces, the appearance of 
the rotor can be visualized with the absence of suction surfaces. It is 
to be considered that a large number of foils worsens the 
manufacturability and increases the contact surface with its associated 
performance losses, but, in turn lessens the load on them and enhances 
the heat recovery effect.<table border="0">

To design the dynamic symmetry suction surface, the defining curves of 
the pressure surface are conveniently deformed so as to model the 
compression and expansion passages to the appropriate size for the 
thermodynamic conditions encountered in their respective fluid streams.<br>
Notice that in the dynamic symmetry foils rotor, the passages are 
tighter at the area joining the pressure and suction surfaces, thereby 
making the design of the central zone geometry more important than the 
design of the edges conducting a minor flow proportion.<br>

Finally the complete preliminary design of the micro-turbine rotor is 
obtained. After assigning a provisional thickness to the foils and 
meshing the model, it can be introduced in the numerical calculations 
program and until the optimum result is reached, several configurations 
of injected fuel quantities, rotation speeds, thicknesses, number and 
geometry of the foils will be tested. Although this preliminary design 
is based on technically consistent calculations, there are many degrees 
of freedom and it is to be expected that the optimization process leads 
to a substantially different and evolved design. Furthermore, phenomena 
to be prevented such as flow separation, instability or vibrations may 
also decisively influence the final design.<br>

Once the foils geometry has been optimized, details for its final 
configuration have to be chosen. The assembly wings on the free edges of
 the passive surface 22 will serve both as a support to transmit the 
efforts to the housing and as an airtight seal. <br>
The chosen arrangement allows for an easy axial assembly of the whole 
turbomachine. Assuming that, for the prototype, an external can 
combustor instead of an annular combustion chamber will be used, only 
three parts are needed for the casing: an air intake nozzle; a block 
integrating the diffuser, inductor, compression and expansion 
collectors; a discharge nozzle. Normally, the rotor assembly wings will 
lay on bearings specifically designed for this purpose.<br>

Should the rotor be manufactured by welding the foils, the suggested 
procedure consist of a first phase in which they are welded in pairs, a 
pressure and a suction foil. In the next phase, all the pairs of the 
rotor are placed in a positioning rack to weld them together. In the 
last stage, the shaft is welded to the set of foils resulting from the 
previous phase. There will usually be an additional phase in which the 
assembly wings are rectified to ensure their geometry is within 
tolerance and the welded joints are brushed up.<br>
Finally, a compact rotor is obtained, lightweight, self-cooled and with an 
integrated heat exchanger. Hereafter are several views of the rotor with 
shaft and assembly wings (all elements are illustrated in the same 
colour).<br>

All the exercises performed in the previous investigations will 
constitute a valuable guide of good practices and learnt lessons for the
 final design of a technological demonstrator that can be proven on a test bed. Previously to this step, some transcendent 
decisions must be made such as the rotor manufacturing process, the 
selection of the appropriate alloy suited to the process with which the 
rotor will be manufactured, or whether to apply a coating material, 
especially in a case where it affects the thermal conductivity of the 
foils.<br>
